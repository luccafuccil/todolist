## Features

- **Create tasks** with title and optional description
- **List all tasks** in an organized way (newest first)
- **Edit existing tasks** when you change your mind
- **Mark as completed** with a simple checkbox click
- **Delete tasks** with an added "undo" option
- **See timestamps** for when each task was created and last edited

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with SSR
- **tRPC**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** - For straightforward, easy to maintain CSS
- **Zod** - For validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/luccafuccil/todolist.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd todolist

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser ðŸŽ‰

## Architecture Overview

### Backend (tRPC)
The entire backend lives in memory (yes, when you restart the server, everything disappears - it was a challenge requirement). The structure is pretty straightforward:

```typescript
// Each task looks like this:
type Todo = {
  id: number;           // Unique auto-generated ID
  name: string;         // Task title (required)
  description?: string; // Optional description
  completed: boolean;   // Whether it's marked as done
  createdAt: Date;      // When it was created
  updatedAt?: Date;     // When it was last edited
}
```

### Frontend
- **Home page (`/`)**: Lists all tasks using SSR
- **Create task (`/add-new`)**: Form to add new tasks
- **Edit task (`/edit?id=X`)**: Form to edit existing tasks

### Special Features

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
The task list is pre-loaded on the server, so you see tasks instantly when the page loads.

**Undo Functionality**  
Deleted a task by mistake? A modal appears asking if you're sure, with an undo option.

**Smart Validations**  
- Can't create two tasks with the same name
- Title can't be empty or just spaces
- 1000 task limit (just in case)
